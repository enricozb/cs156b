## Class Description

This is a projects course in Machine Learning (ML) based on the famous Net-
flix competition, considered the Super Bowl of ML at the time, for recommending
movies to different users. Teams of five students each will compete for creating the
best recommender system by applying ML techniques to a huge data set of usermovie
ratings. The teams can explore different learning models and algorithms
(including novel ones) as well as techniques for regularization and validation, aggregation,
optimization, and other aspects of ML that are applicable to this particular
data set.
